      "Welcome to The Vista, a retro text adventure.",
      "In this game, you'll explore the fantasy realm known only as \"The Vista\". You'll do so via a simple text interface, typing commands and receiving textual responses. As with every text-based game, you must provide commands that the game can recognise, which can involve a certain amount of guesswork. The best strategy here is to keep it simple. Pretty much every command in the game is four words or fewer. For example, \"go north\", \"get sword\", \"look around\", \"check inventory\", \"attack goblin with sword\" etc. So basically just \"verb noun\", or occasionally \"vern noun with noun\". You get the idea. Now let's set the scene...",
      "Fade in.",
      "We start with a traditional, twee fantasy village... Floonyloon Village. It's like The Shire, but without the hairy feet. Enter our hero:... wait, what's your name?",
      "Enter your name: ",
      "Nice. Enter our hero, {name}. You're a young lad / lass, living in the village. Like 9 or 10 years old. The kind of age where your parents definitely shouldn't be letting you go off on dangerous adventures without supervision, but for some reason that doesn't seem to matter here.",
      "You're a stoic, quiet kid. A real Thomas Anderson. Very easy from a dialogue writing perspective.",
