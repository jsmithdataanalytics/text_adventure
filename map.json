      "Fade in.",
      "We start with a traditional twee, idyllic fantasy village... Floonyloon Village. It's like The Shire, but without the hairy feet. Enter our hero:... wait. What's your name?",
      "Enter your name: ",
      "Nice. Enter our hero, {}. You're a young lad / lass, living in the village. Like 9 or 10 years old. The kind of age where your parents definitely shouldn't be letting you go off on dangerous adventures without supervision, but for some reason that doesn't seem to matter here.",
      "You're a stoic, quiet kid. A real Thomas Anderson. Very easy from a dialogue-writing perspective.",
