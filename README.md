# The Vista
Welcome to The Vista, a retro text adventure.

This is a text-based game that I programmed in Python as my first hobby project.

In the game, you'll explore the fantasy realm known only as The Vista. You'll do so via a simple text interface, typing commands and receiving text responses. As with every text-based game, you have to provide commands that the game can recognise, which can involve some guesswork. The best strategy is to keep it simple. Pretty much every command in the game is four words or fewer, e.g. \"go north\", \"get sword\", \"drop all\", \"look around\", \"check inventory\", \"attack goblin with sword\" etc. So basically just \"verb noun\", or occasionally \"verb noun with noun\". You get the idea.
